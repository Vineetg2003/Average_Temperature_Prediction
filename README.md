# Average Temperature Regression

This repository contains a simple linear regression model to predict average temperatures based on the year. The dataset used for this analysis is "Average Temperature 1900-2023.csv".

## Dataset Information

- The dataset has two columns: 'Year' and 'Average_Fahrenheit_Temperature'.
- There are 124 entries with no missing values.

## Files

- `Average Temperature 1900-2023.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the regression model.
- `Regression_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, training the linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express

## Usage

1. Upload the dataset using the provided code.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a linear regression model.
4. Evaluate the model accuracy using mean absolute percentage error.
5. Visualize the actual vs. predicted data using different plotting libraries.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/average-temperature-regression.git
